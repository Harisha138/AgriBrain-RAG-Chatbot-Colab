Instead farmers today have \\na world market to serve. But the new chances bring new challenges. Farmers and agricultural enterprises, \\nwilling to be part of the new expanding world market, not only have to take into consideration customers’ \\npreferences whom they want to serve, but also adhere to international trade regulations set by WTO and \\ncomply with high production and quality standards required by the importing countries.\\nAgriculture contributes around 17% to GDP and continues to be among the most important and success-\\nful sectors in India. Around 58% of the Indian population depend on agriculture for their livelihood. Apart \\nfrom delivering the local industries with top quality raw materials for processing, agriculture provides \\nalmost 10% of total export earnings. However, to support the impressive Indian economic growth in the \\ncoming years, agriculture will have to contribute more towards value addition, productivity enhancement, \\nhigh quality products and trained manpower to successfully tackle these challenges.\\nThe states of Gujarat and Maharashtra have competitive advantages for the production of several com-\\nmodities. However, productivity and competitiveness remains low. Rising quality requirements of export \\nand domestic markets require an up-scaling of the production which is only feasible with educated farmers \\nand skilled workers.\\nDesai Fruits and Vegetables (DFV)in cooperation with the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale \\nZusammenarbeit(GIZ) GmbH on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and \\nDevelopment (BMZ) takes up the existing education gap by implementing a development partnership \\ncalled “Partnership Farming India”\\n.\\nThe goal of Partnership Farming India (PFI) is to enable farmers to be self-sufficient decision-makers, \\n“agripreneurs”\\n, which allows for a more flexible production system and highlights farming as profession by \\nchoice and not by inheritance. \\nFurthermore, PFI strengthens farmers’ and farm workers’ management skills to adopt modern agricul-\\ntural practices and concepts and enhance the international competitiveness of smallholders’ agricultural \\nproduce by giving farmers and workers in Gujarat and Maharashtra access to practical agricultural educa-\\ntion. Therefore, DFV and GIZ in close cooperation with the National Institute of Agricultural Extension \\nManagement (MANAGE, an organization of Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India) developed the \\ntraining material on basic agricultural knowledge and skills.\\nThe states of Gujarat and Maharashtra will serve as an example on how to establish long term successful \\nand trustful business relationships by combining small scale production in the field with large scale pro-\\ncessing and marketing. I am confident that this effort will serve the Indian agriculture as a replicable model \\nmake lasting contributions towards sustainable agriculture and prosperous farmers.\\nI would like to express my sincere gratitude to the people and institutions namely MANAGE, DFV and \\nGIZ,which supported this project and enabled making information available.

Research and Extension systems play major role in generation \\nand dissemination of Agricultural technologies aiming at enhancing the income of farmers. The extension \\nsystem adopts series of extension methods such as Training, demonstration, exposure visit to transfer \\nthe technologies from lab to land. Majority of these extension efforts mainly focus on location and crop \\nspecific technologies, and mostly on solution to problem basis. However, there is a need for equipping the \\nfarmers with Basic knowledge of Agriculture in order to create a better knowledge platform at farmer level \\nfor taking appropriate farm management decisions and to absorb modern technologies.  \\nIn view of this, Desai Fruits and Vegetables Pvt. Ltd. (DFV), India, in cooperation with the Deutsche \\nGesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH on behalf of the German Federal Ministry \\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) in close cooperation with National Institute of Ag-\\nricultural Extension Management (MANAGE- An Organization of Ministry of Agriculture, Government \\nof India) brought out Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture to impart technical knowledge on Basic \\nAgriculture to farmers to provide holistic perspective of scientific Agriculture.\\nThis handbook is a product of series of brainstorming workshops and consultative meetings with various \\nstakeholders such as Researchers, Academicians, Extension Functionaries, Agripreneurs, Master Trainers \\nand Farmers. Based on the identified needs, the topics were prioritized and contents were developed with \\nthe help of experts. The farmer-friendly content has been written in simple language, using more pictures \\nwith practical examples for the benefit of farmers. \\nThe book contains six chapters, each focusing on a particular topic. The first chapter, “General conditions \\nfor cultivation of crops”\\n, talks about the basic needs of farmers and farming sector, by providing basic \\nknowledge on Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), enhancing the awareness of farmers on critical factors \\nin selection of crops and cropping patterns, judicious use of natural resources such as soil and water, and \\nemphasizing the importance of mechanization in the field of agriculture.\\nThe second chapter “Soil and Plant Nutrition” is aimed at increasing the awareness and understanding of \\nfarmers about soil, it’s structure, physical, chemical, biological properties, soil fertility and managing the \\nsoil fertility in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner. It also focuses on the need for \\nsoil testing, plant nutrition requirement, organic & inorganic fertilizers, and Integrated Nutrient Manage-\\nment (INM) for efficient, economic and sustainable production of crops.\\nThe third chapter of the book is about Pest Management, and focuses on enhancing the awareness of and \\nunderstanding among farmers about the crop pests, diseases and weed management through Integrated \\nPest Management. It also aims at sensitizing farmers on safe handling of chemicals and plant protection \\nequipments as also elaborated further in the fifth chapter on “Occupational health and safety of farmers”\\n. \\nIt creates awareness about causes, preventive measures of health hazards, risks & fatalities in agriculture, \\nand use of first aid in emergencies. It further includes safety tips and care to reduce the risk of injuries and \\nfatalities while handling machineries and pesticides by farmers.\\nTime and resources management is an integral part of each and every activity, be it service sector, busi-\\nness or day-to-day activities of life. Farming sector too has not remained untouched by it. Therefore, the \\nfourth chapter of the book is devoted to “Farm Management”\\n. It is to educate and equip the farmers to \\nmake proper plans, take appropriate decisions and also to take advantage of the improved technologies \\nto increase production, assure food security for the family and market opportunities to increase income \\nconsidering available resources, anticipated risks, including market fluctuations.\\n“Farmer’s access to services”\\n, the last chapter of the book, aims at enhancing awareness among farmers \\nabout sources of extension, information and services, public and private extension services, agricultural \\ncredit, insurance and legal aspects through Information & Communication Technologies. The content is \\nuseful not only for farmers but also for other stakeholders involved in farm advisory services such as Agri \\ninput dealers, Agripreneurs, Kisan Call Centers and extension functionaries working at grass roots level. \\nWe trust that this Handbook will benefit maximum number of farmers to make farming economically and \\nenvironmentally more sustainable.\\nB.

Farmers who accessed information from \\nagricultural universities and magazines were less in \\nnumber in the control group. The treatment farmers \\nhad an average yield of 35.65 tons and control farm-\\ners had yield of 22.36 tons of banana per acre. The \\naverage net income of the treatment farmers was Rs \\n93,822 and for the control farmers Rs.81,659.

Insufficient nitrogen can hinder ear development and grain filling.\n","*   **Indeterminate Tillering:** While other deficiencies can sometimes affect tillering, nitrogen deficiency can lead to excessive, weak tillering as the plant tries to compensate for its lack of resources.\n","*   **Curling of Leaf Blades:** While not always present, leaf curling can occur in nitrogen-deficient plants due to disrupted cell growth and water balance.\n","\n","**Other Possible Deficiencies (Less Likely):**\n","\n","While nitrogen is the primary suspect, other deficiencies could contribute to similar symptoms, but usually with additional distinguishing characteristics:\n","\n","*   **Sulfur (S):** Sulfur deficiency can also cause yellowing, but it often starts in younger leaves, unlike nitrogen.\n","*   **Molybdenum (Mo):** Molybdenum is involved in nitrogen metabolism, so a deficiency can indirectly affect nitrogen utilization. However, molybdenum deficiency is less common.\n","\n","**Recommendation:**\n","\n","To confirm the deficiency, consider the following:\n","\n","1.  **Soil Testing:** Analyze the soil to determine the levels of available nutrients, including nitrogen.\n","2.  **Plant Tissue Analysis:** Send plant samples to a lab for tissue analysis to measure the nutrient content in the plant.\n","3.  **Observe the Pattern:** Note which leaves are most affected (older vs. younger) and the overall pattern of symptoms in the field.\n","\n","Once the deficiency is confirmed, apply the appropriate fertilizer containing the deficient nutrient(s) based on soil test recommendations.\n","👨‍🌾 You: >>> stop\n","👋 AgriBrain: >>> Take care and happy farming!\n"]}],"source":["run_agribrain_chatbot()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mzfobHQOvO2t"},"source":["# RAG Evaluation"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8gllfD0IlgbV"},"source":["## Create a vector storage and a retriver"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"PYHTVocjlOvc","outputId":"2cab5602-f3ac-4bc6-c2e7-4aa17e2d8dde"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/langchain_community/document_loaders/parsers/pdf.py:300: UserWarning: Warning: Empty content on page 7 of document /content/farmerbook-1-20.pdf\n","  warnings.warn(\n"]}],"source":["docs = []\n","docs_path = \"/content/\"\n","\n","if not os.path.exists(docs_path):\n","    os.makedirs(docs_path)\n","\n","for file in os.listdir(docs_path):\n","    if file.endswith(\".pdf\"):\n","        # print(file)\n","        loader = PyMuPDFLoader(os.path.join(docs_path, file))\n","        docs.extend(loader.load())\n","\n","if docs:\n","    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1500,\n","                                                 chunk_overlap=200)\n","    chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)\n","    embeddings = GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings(model=\"models/embedding-001\")\n","    client = chromadb.PersistentClient(path=\"./chroma_db\")\n","    # Use Chroma from LangChain\n","    vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(\n","        documents=chunks,\n","        embedding=embeddings,\n","        client=client,\n","        collection_name=\"document_collection\"\n","    )\n","\n","    # Define retriever object\n","    retriever = vectordb.as_retriever(search_type=\"similarity_score_threshold\", search_kwargs={\"k\": 3, \"score_threshold\": 0.3})"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ofCXUt0dlPV2"},"source":["## Create the RAG pipeline"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"yQ1cclCpl4v-"},"outputs":[],"source":["from IPython.display import display, Markdown\n","\n","def display_docs(docs):\n","    for doc in docs:\n","        print('Metadata:', doc.metadata)\n","        print('Content Brief:')\n","        display(Markdown(doc.page_content))\n","        print()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":740},"id":"mauUaIqvl8Da","outputId":"bf84406e-4b49-4061-cac5-8b3ef7be7ed3"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Metadata: {'author': '', 'creationDate': '', 'creator': '', 'file_path': '/content/farmerbook-1-20.pdf', 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'keywords': '', 'modDate': 'D:20250408072807Z', 'page': 5, 'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'source': '/content/farmerbook-1-20.pdf', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'total_pages': 20, 'trapped': ''}\n","Content Brief:\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"],"text/markdown":"Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture\nPreface\nA\ngriculture is an important sector of Indian Economy as more than half of its population relies on Ag-\nriculture as principle source of income.

Runoff, caused by unmanaged rainfall or irrigation, contributes to water erosion by transporting soil particles away, exacerbating soil degradation. Different types of erosion include water erosion, sheet erosion, and rill erosion. Water erosion removes soil from the land's surface, while sheet erosion uniformly removes topsoil, often going unnoticed but severely impacting soil fertility. Rill erosion, characterized by shallow channels, is more visible and can be addressed through cultivation. Vegetation helps reduce runoff and erosion by intercepting rainfall, binding soil with root structures, and enhancing soil's water-holding capacity through biological processes. Implementing effective vegetation cover can significantly improve soil stability and water retention, essential for sustainable agriculture.\n","  - context: ['10\\nGeneral Conditions for Cultivation of Crops\\nFarmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture\\n1.5.

Research and Extension systems play major role in generation \\nand dissemination of Agricultural technologies aiming at enhancing the income of farmers. The extension \\nsystem adopts series of extension methods such as Training, demonstration, exposure visit to transfer \\nthe technologies from lab to land. Majority of these extension efforts mainly focus on location and crop \\nspecific technologies, and mostly on solution to problem basis. However, there is a need for equipping the \\nfarmers with Basic knowledge of Agriculture in order to create a better knowledge platform at farmer level \\nfor taking appropriate farm management decisions and to absorb modern technologies.  \\nIn view of this, Desai Fruits and Vegetables Pvt. Ltd. (DFV), India, in cooperation with the Deutsche \\nGesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH on behalf of the German Federal Ministry \\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) in close cooperation with National Institute of Ag-\\nricultural Extension Management (MANAGE- An Organization of Ministry of Agriculture, Government \\nof India) brought out Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture to impart technical knowledge on Basic \\nAgriculture to farmers to provide holistic perspective of scientific Agriculture.\\nThis handbook is a product of series of brainstorming workshops and consultative meetings with various \\nstakeholders such as Researchers, Academicians, Extension Functionaries, Agripreneurs, Master Trainers \\nand Farmers. Based on the identified needs, the topics were prioritized and contents were developed with \\nthe help of experts. The farmer-friendly content has been written in simple language, using more pictures \\nwith practical examples for the benefit of farmers. \\nThe book contains six chapters, each focusing on a particular topic. The first chapter, “General conditions \\nfor cultivation of crops”\\n, talks about the basic needs of farmers and farming sector, by providing basic \\nknowledge on Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), enhancing the awareness of farmers on critical factors \\nin selection of crops and cropping patterns, judicious use of natural resources such as soil and water, and \\nemphasizing the importance of mechanization in the field of agriculture.\\nThe second chapter “Soil and Plant Nutrition” is aimed at increasing the awareness and understanding of \\nfarmers about soil, it’s structure, physical, chemical, biological properties, soil fertility and managing the \\nsoil fertility in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner. It also focuses on the need for \\nsoil testing, plant nutrition requirement, organic & inorganic fertilizers, and Integrated Nutrient Manage-\\nment (INM) for efficient, economic and sustainable production of crops.\\nThe third chapter of the book is about Pest Management, and focuses on enhancing the awareness of and \\nunderstanding among farmers about the crop pests, diseases and weed management through Integrated \\nPest Management. It also aims at sensitizing farmers on safe handling of chemicals and plant protection \\nequipments as also elaborated further in the fifth chapter on “Occupational health and safety of farmers”\\n. \\nIt creates awareness about causes, preventive measures of health hazards, risks & fatalities in agriculture, \\nand use of first aid in emergencies. It further includes safety tips and care to reduce the risk of injuries and \\nfatalities while handling machineries and pesticides by farmers.\\nTime and resources management is an integral part of each and every activity, be it service sector, busi-\\nness or day-to-day activities of life. Farming sector too has not remained untouched by it. Therefore, the \\nfourth chapter of the book is devoted to “Farm Management”\\n. It is to educate and equip the farmers to \\nmake proper plans, take appropriate decisions and also to take advantage of the improved technologies \\nto increase production, assure food security for the family and market opportunities to increase income \\nconsidering available resources, anticipated risks, including market fluctuations.\\n“Farmer’s access to services”\\n, the last chapter of the book, aims at enhancing awareness among farmers \\nabout sources of extension, information and services, public and private extension services, agricultural \\ncredit, insurance and legal aspects through Information & Communication Technologies.

Research and Extension systems play major role in generation \\nand dissemination of Agricultural technologies aiming at enhancing the income of farmers. The extension \\nsystem adopts series of extension methods such as Training, demonstration, exposure visit to transfer \\nthe technologies from lab to land. Majority of these extension efforts mainly focus on location and crop \\nspecific technologies, and mostly on solution to problem basis. However, there is a need for equipping the \\nfarmers with Basic knowledge of Agriculture in order to create a better knowledge platform at farmer level \\nfor taking appropriate farm management decisions and to absorb modern technologies.  \\nIn view of this, Desai Fruits and Vegetables Pvt. Ltd. (DFV), India, in cooperation with the Deutsche \\nGesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH on behalf of the German Federal Ministry \\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) in close cooperation with National Institute of Ag-\\nricultural Extension Management (MANAGE- An Organization of Ministry of Agriculture, Government \\nof India) brought out Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture to impart technical knowledge on Basic \\nAgriculture to farmers to provide holistic perspective of scientific Agriculture.\\nThis handbook is a product of series of brainstorming workshops and consultative meetings with various \\nstakeholders such as Researchers, Academicians, Extension Functionaries, Agripreneurs, Master Trainers \\nand Farmers.

It also focuses on the need for \\nsoil testing, plant nutrition requirement, organic & inorganic fertilizers, and Integrated Nutrient Manage-\\nment (INM) for efficient, economic and sustainable production of crops.\\nThe third chapter of the book is about Pest Management, and focuses on enhancing the awareness of and \\nunderstanding among farmers about the crop pests, diseases and weed management through Integrated \\nPest Management. It also aims at sensitizing farmers on safe handling of chemicals and plant protection \\nequipments as also elaborated further in the fifth chapter on “Occupational health and safety of farmers”\\n. \\nIt creates awareness about causes, preventive measures of health hazards, risks & fatalities in agriculture, \\nand use of first aid in emergencies. It further includes safety tips and care to reduce the risk of injuries and \\nfatalities while handling machineries and pesticides by farmers.\\nTime and resources management is an integral part of each and every activity, be it service sector, busi-\\nness or day-to-day activities of life. Farming sector too has not remained untouched by it. Therefore, the \\nfourth chapter of the book is devoted to “Farm Management”\\n.
